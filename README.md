# Proxy
All instructions given inside files with bunch of(and i mean lots of it) comments 

just copy the code from [proxy.js](https://github.com/1Hira0/Proxy/blob/master/src/proxy.js)
and 
```
npm i node-fetch express morgan
```
or if you use yarn
```
yarn add node-fetch express morgan
```
about Morgan, this just logs server requests - if you're not gonna look at it, dont install this
```
node proxy.js
```
should do the trick
#AGAIN, NO RESPONSIBILITY IS HELD IF ANY CODE IS USED FROM THIS BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE OWNER OF THIS REPOSITORY
